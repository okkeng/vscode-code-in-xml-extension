# Code in XML

Add syntax highlighting to embedded code blocks inside XML files. Support languages are following:  

- `<groovy>`
- `<javascript>`
- `<python>`

I made this extensions to help developers who work with XML DSL files that contain embedded code snippets.  
Here is the sample XML DSL file Images before and after applying this extension's syntax highlighting:

I hope that colored lines help you to read codes easily and quickly:

Future plans:  

- Enable the linter and formatter settings for each language
- Support another language if needed

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

Install an XML extension for XML syntax highlighting, such as:  

- [XML Tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DotJoshJohnson.xml)
- [XML](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-xml)

Additionally, add your preferred extensions for the languages you want to use, such as:  

- [Groovy Lint, Format and Fix](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=NicolasVuillamy.vscode-groovy-lint) (for `source.groovy` highlight)  
- [Python extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python) (for `source.python` highlight)
- VS Code built-in JavaScript grammar is used automatically (for `source.js` highlight)

Don't forget to add the necessary libraries to your Java project. See:  

- [Expression Languages](https://camel.apache.org/components/4.10.x/languages/index.html)
- [Java DSL](https://docs.spring.io/spring-integration/reference/dsl.html)
